Relacional Operators: ( it will always have  boolean value)
> is more than
ex: 5>2 is true
< is less than
ex:7<4 is false
>= is more than or equal 
ex: 8>=8 is true
<= is less than or equal
ex: 9<=7 is false
== is equal
ex: 5==5 is true
!= is diferent
ex: 4!=4 is false
p.s: we can use relational operator to compare: 
price >=200.50 // Is the price more than or equal the 200.50?
age <18 // is the age less than 18?
Java course =='javaScript' course // Is the Java course equal the javaScript course/
n1!=n2 // Is the number 1 diferent the number 2?
Relational Identity Operators:
== is all equal
ex: 5==5 true
=='' is identical
ex: 5=='5' true
==='' is restricted identical ( internal value equal but type of diferent)
ex: 5==='5' false
=== is identical:
ex: 5===5 true
!= is unequal
ex: 5!= 5 false
!== ''is restrictted unequal (type of diferent but internal value equalS)
ex: 5!=='5' true
Logical Operators:
! is negation (nÃ£o) / unary operator
ex:
    ! true - false
    ! false - true
&& is conjunction (e) / binary operator
ex: 
    true && true - true
    true && false -false
    false && true -false
    false && false - false
|| is disjunction (or) / binary operator
ex: 
    true || true - true
    true || false - true
    false || true - true
    false || false - false
    p.s: we can use the identyc relational operator and logical operator to compare:
age >=15 && age<=17 // Is the age between 15 and 17?
state =='RJ'|| state =='SP' // Is the state RJ or The State SP?
salary>1500 && sexo!='M' // Is the salary high 1500 and the gender isn't masculine?
Precedence Order:
First Arithmetic - second Relational - third Logical
Tenary Operator:
? :  it has tree parts.
ex1: average>=7.0 ? "approved" : "disapproved"
ex2:  var age = 19 // var r = age >=18 ? "the most" : "least" // 'the most'
