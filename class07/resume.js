Kind of Operator of the JS:
arithmetic- attribution - relational - logical - ternary;
Arithmetic:
+ to add
ex: 5+2 > 7
- to subtrct
ex: 5-2 >3
* to multiply
ex: 5*2 >10
/ to divide
ex: 5/2 >2.5
% to get the result of the rest of the divison.
ex: 5%2 >1
** to pontetiation(to high squared)
ex: 5**2 >25
Operator precedence order:
first () to separate numeric account
second ** pontentiation
third * multiply
forth / divide
fifth % the rest divison
sixth + addiction
seventh - subtraction
Simple Attribution Operator:
var a = 5+3 kept 8  
var b = a%5 kept 3
var c = 5*b**2 kept 45
var d = 10-a/2 kept 6
var e = 6*2/d kept 2
var f = b%e+4/e kept 3
Self attribution and simplifying self attribution:
var n = 3 ...n is 3
n=n+4 n+=4 ... n left be 3 now n is 7
n=n-5 n-=5 ...n left be 7 now n is 2
n=n*4 n*=4...n left be 2 now n is 8
n=n/2 n/=2 ...n left be 8 now n is 4
n=n**2 n**=2 ...n left be 4 now n is 16
n=n%5 n%=5 ... n left be 16 now n is 1
Increment Operators:
var x = 5 ....x is 5
x=x+1  x++ ... x  left 5 now x is 6
ex1:
var a= 2 / a is 2 / a++ 2 / after add a++ 3 (pos increment )
var a = 2 / a is 2 / ++a 3 / already add (pre increment)
Decrement Operators:
var x = 5 ....x is 5
x=x-1  x-- ... x left 5 now x is 4
exe2:
var a= 2 / a is 2 / a--2 / after subtraction a-- 1 (pos increment)
var a = 2 / a is 2 / --a 1  already subtraction (pre increment)
