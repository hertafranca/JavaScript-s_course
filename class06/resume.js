Make resume about 06 class at least 5 lines. Using my own words.
Data manipulation in javascript was used the command:
 var to keep what was type into prompt within the variable;
Diference between (+) to junction (concatenation) of the string and (+) 
 to add of the number is need to convert of the string to number;
Use the command:number.parseInt(n) to convert of the string to number(integer);
Use the command:number.parseFloat(n)) to convert of the string to number(comma);
In the most current version use the command:number(n) because it already 
converts to integer numbers like numbers with comma;
Use the command:string(n) to convert of the number to string;
Use the command:n.tostring() to convert of the number to string, too;
Formatting string:
ex1: 
var s= javascript / "I'm studing" + s / " I'm studing Javascript".
 (was used a concatenation);
ex2:
 was created three variables (name = Herta, age= 44, grade= 10);
After was made a concatenation with mensage:
 'The student' + name + 'with' + age + 'years old got the grade' + grade 
 'The student Herta with 44 years old got the grade 10'
In the most curreny version use the command called of template string:`${s}` use
to make an interpolation of the string with variable;
ex1: 
'The student' + name + 'with' + age + 'years old got the grade' + grade 
` The student ${name} with ${age} years old got the grade ${grade}`
'The student Herta com 44 anos de idade tirou a nota 10'
Use the command: s.length to know how many characters the string has;
Use the command: s.toUpperCase() to change all string to capital letter;
Use the command: s.toLowerCase() to change all string to miniscule letter;
Use the command: document.write() that same alert() to write in window;
use the command: <br/> to a line break;used to html.
Formatting numbers:
ex1: 
var n1 = 1545.5 / n1 1545.5 ;
Use the command:toFixed(2) to put two decimal places;
ex2:
n1.tofixed(2) / '1545.50'
Use the command:replace('' , '') to change a thing for other thing;
Use the command: 
toLocaleString('pt-BR' , {style:'currency' , currency:'BRL' }) serves to change
 the number to Brazilian currency;
 Use the command: 
 toLocaleString('pt-BR' , {style:'currency' , currency:'USD' }) serves to change
 the number to American currency;
 Use the command:
 toLocaleString('pt-BR' , {style:'currency' , currency:'EUR' }) serves to change
 the number to  currency;
